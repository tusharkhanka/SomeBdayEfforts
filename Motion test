   (i) Give an example each for direct and indirect evidences of motion.
   (ii) Give an example each of simple and complex motion.
   (iii) Give an example of controlled and un-controlled motion.
7. Describe uniform and non-uniform motion with example.

12. (i) We can use the distance-time graph to determine _________ of an object?
    (ii) We can use the velocity-time graph to determine _________ of an object?
13. Draw velocity-time graphs to descrive uniform acceleration and non-uniform acceleration.
14. What can you say about the motion of an object whose distance-time graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis?
15. What can you say about the motion of an object if its speed-time graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis?
16. What is the quantity which is measured by the area occupied below the velocity-time graph?
17. Write the 3 equations of motion that we can derive by these graphical representations.
18. Give an example when an object does not change its magnitude of velocity but only its direction of motion?
19. How many times will an athlete have to change his direction of motion, while he completes one round of a hexagonal track ABCDEF?
20. If the athlete takes t seconds to go once around the circular path of radius r, the speed v is?
21. Define uniform and non-uniform circular motion. Give an example for each.
22. State which of the following situations are possible and give an example for each of these:
    (a) an object with a constant acceleration but with zero velocity
    (b) an object moving with an acceleration but with uniform speed.
    (c) an object moving in a certain direction with an acceleration in the perpendicular direction.
